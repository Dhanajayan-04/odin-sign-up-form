This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundation Course, designed to practice HTML, CSS, and basic form validation by building a responsive sign-up form.

## Project Overview

The odin-sign-up-form is a clean and modern web page that replicates a typical sign-up form. It serves as a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, flexbox/grid layout, and client-side form validation.

## Features

- Responsive sign-up form with visually appealing design.
- Custom input validation for password fields and required fields.
- Clear feedback to users when form inputs are invalid.
- Layout that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
